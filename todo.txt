TODO:
o   Different shape types (box, rounded box, circle, oval, diamond, parallelagram)
o   Fix angle4 so it is right angles some how, probably need a
starting direction in name of link, angle4u/d/l/r, then last
direction is implied by where shape is?

ox Different line types - right angle3, angle4, angle5, curve3,
curve5
